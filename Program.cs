            // Task 1: Create a new, empty list of strings here.
            // Hint: Remember the using directive?


            // Task 2: Add 3 strings to your list - their values can be anything.


            // Task 3: Iterate or loop through your list with a foreach loop printing each element to the console.


            // Task 4: Save and run your program with dotnet run.
            // Push your changes to github.
            // Check github.com and see if your changes are in the repository online


            // Challenge Task 5: Make a method called RemoveFromList()
            // This method should take 2 parameters - a list of strings and the specific string you want to remove.
            // It should return a bool (true or false).
            // The method should check if the list contains the specific element using an if statement and .Contains()
            // If the list contains the element, return true, otherwise return false

            // Call RemoveFromList() here in Main.



            // Task 6: Clear the list and verify that it is cleared by printing out its Count to the console


            // Task 7: Save and run your program. Answer the questions in README.md. You can modify README.md directly
            // from inside VS Code. Put your name at the top of the README.md file


            // Task 8: Push your changes to GitHub and verify that they are uploaded


            // Congratulations. You just completed your first lab exercise and practiced lists, methods, and git. Good work.
